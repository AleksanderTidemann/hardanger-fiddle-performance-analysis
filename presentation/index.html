                        <p>One these dances is springar, a couples dance most often in triplet meter(waltz time signature).</p>
                        <p>Now, there are many regional and localized "sub-styles" of springar, where some possess the interesting stylistic features of asymmetrical timing patterns.</p>
                        <p>This refers to the systematic unevenness (asymmetry) in the duration and position of the musical beats.</p>
                        <p>Given the systamtic unevenness, we often refer to these timing patterns as part of specific durationl categories, such as "long-average-short", "long-long-short" or "short-long-long".</p>
                        <p>Let me give a short demonstration of this asymmetry via a Tele-springar performance</p>

                        <p>Here, pay attention to the foot stomping of the fiddler, indicating this triplet meter asymmetrical timing pattern.</p>
                        <p>....</p>
                        <p>So these asymmetrical timing patterns are expressed differently than regular triplet timing. like 1---,2---.,3.1---,2---,3 etc-</p>
                        <p>While in contrast, a regular Waltz beat is usually just like: 1,2,3,1,2,3</p>
                        <p>HOWEVER, as you might have heard, these performances exhibit a great deal of rhythmic variability. So it kind of fluctates alot.</p>

                            <p>second, in addition to perf-data, we can add the structural data discussed in the previous slide. which adds the data to the dict.</p>

                            <p>Choose a range (from a bar to a bar), click plot, and the program will see if the particular range we selected repeats itself in the peformance (is part of a phrase, motif or section).

                            <p>The Plot shows beats along the X-axis and Beat durations along the Y-axis.</p>
                            <p>In this example, we found 4 instances of a repeating phrase (from b 17-18). As we can see, the timing patterns of these repititions are fairly consistent throughout the performance, only with greater variations at the start.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, various plotting settings enable us to view the data in various ways.</p>

                                <p>Important to note that this tool is still under development, so features are constantly added and improved.</p>
                                <p>An example is note scaling when adjusting the beats (part 1). Research suggests that there often are some notes that are more essential to the beat length than others.</p>
                                <p>Similarly, having the ability to propegate the adjustments you make to one section to all of its repeating instances, would also be interesting to explore</p>
                                <p>This last feature I have actually developed, but not yet implemented because of time and priorirtes.</p>

                            <p>Timing pattern formalization is not optimal at all, but serves this prototyping purpose well. We would probably much rather define timing patterns in this context as a collection of inter-onset intervals or something along those lines.</p>
                            <p>Finally, a very nice feature would be to examine the motivic or structural position of the regions with similar patterns. This is highly possible, but is only limited by the scope of this thesis.</p>
